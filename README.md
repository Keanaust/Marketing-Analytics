# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

This repository contains the project materials for analyzing customer churn in a telecommunications company. The goal of this project is to understand the drivers of churn and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on identifying key factors contributing to customer churn using advanced data analytics techniques. By leveraging the Telco Customer dataset, I aim to build a predictive model that enables better decision-making for retention strategies.

## Key Highlights

### Data
- **Dataset**: `Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`
- Features include customer demographics, service details, and churn status.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values and inconsistencies.
   - Encoded categorical variables.
   - Standardized numerical data for modeling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Uncovered patterns and trends in customer behavior.
   - Visualized relationships between features and churn.
3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Built classification models to predict churn.
   - Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Results
- Key drivers of churn identified include contract type, monthly charges, and tenure.
- Insights provide actionable recommendations for reducing churn.
